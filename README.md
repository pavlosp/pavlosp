## 👋 Hi, I’m Pavlos Papaefstathiou @pavlosp

👀 I’m interested in literally everything: understanding how things work, from physics to technology and engineering. This is my GitHub space to share projects I am currently working on. Many of them are private which I will make public when ready :) .

🌱 I’m currently learning and experimenting with:
- Web / Mobile app development
- Analog and digital electronics, audio applications (DACs, network streamers, audio mixers, audio interfaces, synthesizers etc.)
