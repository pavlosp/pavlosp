## 👋 Hi, I’m @pavlosp

👀 I’m interested in literally everything: understanding how things work, from physics to technology and engineering. This is my GitHub space to share projects I am currently working on.

🌱 I’m currently learning and experimenting with:
- Analog and digital electronics, especially audio applications (DACs, network streamers, audio mixers, audio interfaces, synthesizers etc.)
- Embedded machine learning (TFLite for microcontrollers)
- Mobile / Web app development

Most of my projects are currently private, given that they are very early work-in-progress projects with partial functionality... the intent is to publish them when more complete.
